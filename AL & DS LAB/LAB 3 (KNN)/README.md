## ðŸŒ¸ What is the **Iris Dataset**?

Think of it like a **table** with information about **flowers**.
There are **3 types of iris flowers**:

* **Setosa**
* **Versicolor**
* **Virginica**

Each flower has **4 features**:

1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

This dataset tells us the measurements of each flower, and its correct type (name).

## ðŸ§  What is this code doing?

This code is teaching a **computer** how to look at a flower's measurements and **predict what kind of flower** it is.

---

### Letâ€™s break it step-by-step ðŸ‘£

---

### 1. **Importing important tools**

We use tools from a library called `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`) â€” just like you use math tools from a geometry box.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
```

This is a machine learning model called **KNN** â€” it looks at the *nearest neighbors* to decide which flower it is.

---

### 2. **Loading the iris dataset**

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
irisData = load_iris()
```

This loads the flower data (like opening an Excel file).

* `X = irisData.data` â€“ this is the measurements of the flowers.
* `y = irisData.target` â€“ this is the actual flower type (0 = Setosa, 1 = Versicolor, 2 = Virginica).

---

### 3. **Splitting the data into Training and Testing**

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

This splits the data into:

* **Training Data (80%)**: For learning.
* **Testing Data (20%)**: For checking if the learning worked.

---

### 4. **Train the KNN model**

```python
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

We create a **KNN model with 3 neighbors** and train it using the training data.
Now the model has "learned" how to recognize flower types.

---

### 5. **Predict using the model**

```python
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)
```

We give it some new flowers (test data) and ask it to **guess** the flower type.

---

### 6. **Checking how good it is**

```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
```

These scores tell us how well the model guessed:

| Term         | Meaning                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy  | % of total correct guesses                          |
| ðŸŽ¯ Precision | How many of the guessed types were correct          |
| ðŸŽ¯ Recall    | How many of the actual types were guessed correctly |
| ðŸŽ¯ F1 Score  | A combined score (Precision + Recall)               |

---

### 7. **Count correct and wrong guesses**

```python
correct = sum(y_pred == y_test)
wrong = sum(y_pred != y_test)
```

We count how many times the model guessed right and how many times it was wrong.

---

### 8. **Show full report**

```python
classification_report(...)
```

This prints a detailed report for each flower type.

---

### 9. **Confusion Matrix**

```python
confusion_matrix(...)
```

This is a **chart** that shows where the model guessed correctly and where it got confused between flower types.

---

### 10. **Final Output**

The code prints out:

* Accuracy %
* Precision, Recall, F1 Score
* Correct / Wrong guesses
* A nice chart showing the modelâ€™s performance

## ðŸ’¡ Simple Summary:

> We're teaching a computer to **identify flowers** using their measurements.
> We use a method called **KNN** (K-Nearest Neighbors).
> Then, we test how well it learned by checking its predictions.
> Finally, we show the results as numbers and graphs.
