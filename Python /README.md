## LAB 2: Functions, Strings, and Lists

### [-> Programs <-](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/Python%20/PROGRAMS/class_2.ipynb)

### Experiment 2: Problems on Function and Function Calls
1. **Bubble Sort Implementation**  
   Implement the bubble sort algorithm using a function to sort a given list of numbers.

2. **Occurrence of a Number**  
   Write a program to find the occurrence of a specific number in a list using a function.

### Experiment 3: String Traversal and String Methods
1. **String Traversal**  
   Read and print a string using `range()` and `enumerate()` functions.

2. **String Manipulation**  
   Perform the following operations on a string:
   - Create a string.
   - Convert the string to uppercase.
   - Convert the string to lowercase.
   - Swap the cases of the string.
   - Capitalize the string.
   - Print the original string.
   - Convert the string to title case.

### Experiment 4: List Traversal and List Operations
1. **List Traversal Methods**  
   Implement different methods to traverse and print a list:
   - Using `len()`.
   - Using `range()`.
   - Using `enumerate()`.

2. **List Operations**  
   Perform the following operations on a list:
   - Add elements using `append()`.
   - Add elements using `insert()`.
   - Remove elements using `remove()`.
   - Sort elements in descending order using `sort()` and `reverse()`.

## LAB 3: Graphical Representation and Probability Distributions

### [-> Programs <-](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/Python%20/PROGRAMS/3rd_lab%20.ipynb)

### Experiment 5: Graphical Representation of Data
1. **Plotting a Graph**  
   Plot the graph for the equation `y = x^4 + 5`.

2. **Normal and Stem Graphs**  
   Plot normal and stem graphs using Python.

3. **Bar Chart Representation**  
   Draw a bar chart to represent the area of continents:
   - Africa: 11.7 million sq. miles  
   - Asia: 10.4 million sq. miles  
   - Europe: 1.9 million sq. miles  
   - North America: 9.4 million sq. miles  
   - Oceania: 3.3 million sq. miles  
   - South America: 6.9 million sq. miles  
   - Soviet Union: 7.9 million sq. miles  

4. **Full-Wave Rectifier Graph**  
   Draw the input and output graph of a full-wave rectifier in a single graph.

5. **Histogram Representation**  
   Draw a histogram for the given student height data:

   | Height of student (m) | 135 - 140 | 140 - 145 | 145 - 150 | 150 - 155 |
   |-----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | No. of students       | 4         | 12        | 16        | 8         |

### Experiment 6: Binomial and Poisson Distribution
1. **Binomial Distribution**  
   If `X` is binomially distributed with 6 trials and a probability of success equal to 0.25 at each attempt, find:
   - The probability of exactly 4 successes.
   - The probability of at least one success.

2. **Poisson Distribution**  
   If the random variable `X` follows a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3.4, find `P(X=6)`.

## LAB 4: Tuples, Dictionaries, and File Operations

### [-> Programs <-](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/Python%20/PROGRAMS/Lab_4.ipynb)

### Experiment 7: Tuples and Dictionary Operations
1. **Even and Odd Tuples**  
   Read a tuple of numbers and print separate tuples for even and odd numbers.

2. **Dictionary Operations**  
   Create a dictionary to store book titles and their corresponding stock. Perform the following operations:
   - Access values.
   - Add or update values.
   - Remove key-value pairs.
   - Check if a key exists.
   - Get all keys.
   - Find the length of the dictionary.
   - Merge dictionaries.
   - Print the updated dictionary.

### Experiment 8: File Operations
1. **Prime Numbers from a File**  
   Read a set of numbers stored in a file and print the prime numbers among them.

2. **Text File Analysis**  
   Count the number of words, sentences, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special symbols in a text file.
