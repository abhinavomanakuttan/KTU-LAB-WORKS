# Operating Systems Lab  

## Experiment No: 2  

### Objective  
To write simple shell programs demonstrating basic functions, loops, and patterns.  

### Programs  

1. **Program to Display Personal Information**  
   Write a program to display the following details:  
   - Name  
   - Semester  
   - Batch  
   - Roll Number  
   - Register Number  

2. **Program to Display the Sum of Two Numbers**  
   Write a program that takes two numbers as input and displays their sum.  

3. **Program to Display the Biggest of Two Numbers**  
   Write a program that takes two numbers as input and displays the larger number.  

4. **Program to Print the First 10 Natural Numbers**  
   Write a program to display the first 10 natural numbers (1 to 10).  

5. **Program to Find the Factorial of a Number**  
   Write a program to calculate and display the factorial of a given number.  

6. **Program to Find the Fibonacci Series up to N Numbers**  
   Write a program to generate and display the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.  

7. **Program to Implement a Simple Calculator**  
   Write a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.  

### Instructions  
- Ensure proper use of shell scripting conventions.  
- Test each program thoroughly to validate functionality.  
- Document inputs and outputs for each program.  

### Tools Used  
- Shell Scripting  

### Notes  
- Use comments within the scripts to explain the logic and flow of each program.  
- Follow best practices for writing readable and maintainable code.
