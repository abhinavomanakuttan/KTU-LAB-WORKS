## Experiment No: 3

### Objective  
To write programs that implement system-level concepts such as process control, file handling, and directory operations.

### Programs  

1. **Program to Implement `fork()`, `exec()`, `getpid()`, `exit()`**  
   [Write a program that demonstrates the use of the following system calls:](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/OS%20Lab/PROGRAMS/program1.c)  
   - `fork()`: Creates a new process.
   - `exec()`: Replaces the current process with a new process.
   - `getpid()`: Returns the process ID of the calling process.
   - `exit()`: Terminates the calling process.

2. **Program to Implement `stat()`**  
   [Write a program that uses the `stat()` system call to retrieve and display the information of a specified file.](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/OS%20Lab/PROGRAMS/program2.c)  
   - The program should display the file size, permissions, last modification time, etc.

3. **Program to Implement `opendir()`, `readdir()`, `closedir()`**  
   [Write a program that opens a directory, reads its contents, and then closes the directory using the following system calls:](https://github.com/abhinavomanakuttan/KTU-LAB-WORKS/blob/main/OS%20Lab/PROGRAMS/program3.c)  
   - `opendir()`: Opens a directory stream.
   - `readdir()`: Reads a directory entry.
   - `closedir()`: Closes the directory stream.

## Experiment No: 4

### AIM  
To perform file I/O using system calls in Linux such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files using low-level system calls.

### Programs  

1. **Creating a New File**  
   [Write a program to create a new file using system calls in Linux.] ()

2. **Program to Create, Open, Write, and Read a File**  
   [Write a program that performs the following operations:]  ()
   - Creates a new file (if it doesn't exist).
   - Opens the file for writing and reading.
   - Writes some data into the file.
   - Reads and displays the data from the file.

### Instructions  
- Ensure proper use of shell scripting conventions.  
- For C programs in Experiment 3, compile and run them on a Linux environment to test functionality.  
- Document inputs and outputs for each program.  

### Tools Used  
- Shell Scripting  
- C Programming  

### Notes  
- Use comments within the scripts and C code to explain the logic and flow of each program.  
- Follow best practices for writing readable and maintainable code.
